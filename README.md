## Guitar Hero
• Designed a sound synthesizer in Java which can play music similar to the popular game, Guitar Hero. 

• Implemented a Double-Ended Queue (Deque) in the data structure component of the project using both linked lists and arrays.

• Emulated a piano with the 37 keys on the keyboard. The "white keys" are mapped to the 'qwerty' and 'zxcv' rows, while the "black keys" correspond to the '12345' and 'asdf' rows of the keyboard.
